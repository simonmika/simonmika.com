title: Taking Risk When Dying
---
In the beginning, most startups are like _fatally ill patients_. They are companies _without a business_.

> A startup without product-market fit is like a patient without a cure – both are fighting against time.

When people are fatally ill with a deadly disease with no cure, they tend to be willing to try _any potential cure_, no matter how untested, experimental, or even dangerous and life-threatening it might be. After all, they are already dying, so they have _nothing to lose_ and can therefore take _immense risks_.

A startup which has not yet achieved _product-market fit_ in a market big enough to sustain the company long-term is _dying_. Paul Graham calls this state "[_default dead_](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html)". Just like a patient who knows they will die within months if a new miraculous cure doesn't work, a startup in this phase knows that their _money in the bank_ will only last a certain amount of time. Before that runs out, they either need to find a _cure_ or at least a _treatment_ that will prolong their life another year or so. Like the dying patient, they might have to choose between a _potentially deadly cure_ or a treatment that might, at best, give them some _extra time_ before the inevitable.

> Take small doses to find the cure, but once found, don't hold back – there's no such thing as being half cured.

This is why startups in this phase _need to take risks_. If they don't, they die. But they should always take _calculated_ risks. Try a _small dose_ of the untested drug and look for signs of improvement in the patient's health. If there are none, then keep trying others. Once you think you've found the cure, _stop all other experiments_ and take the _full dose_. There's no way to take a half dose and become half cured, so _bet everything_ on it and don't hold back. You can consider revisiting your pet ideas once the patient is _actually cured_.
