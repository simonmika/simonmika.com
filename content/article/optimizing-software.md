title: Optimizing Software
---
Many programmers, especially those early in their careers, focus heavily on optimizing their code for _execution speed_. They do this because they take pride in their work and want to do it well - which is admirable. However, when programmers optimize for speed, they often get it wrong, particularly when applying _theoretical concepts_ learned in university algorithm courses.

> Most attempts at optimizing for speed end up being _counterproductive_.

All too often, developers sacrifice _readability_ and _maintainability_ to achieve marginal - sometimes unmeasurable - improvements in execution speed. In the worst case, the "optimized" code actually performs _worse_ or introduces _bugs_. In the best case, they succeed only in optimizing for a specific CPU architecture, making their code less _portable_ and harder to maintain.

But why is performance optimization so challenging?

## Code locality
> Only optimize the parts of the code base you know are critical for _perceived performance_.

Most programs spend _80-90%_ of their execution time in just _10-20%_ of their code (this is known as the _90/10 rule_ or the _Pareto principle_ applied to performance). Optimizing code outside these _critical paths_ rarely yields noticeable improvements. Therefore, focus your optimization efforts only on the parts of your codebase that _profiling_ shows are critical for perceived performance.

## Data locality
> How our algorithms _access memory_ often has a bigger impact on performance than CPU optimizations.

In modern computers, there's a significant speed disparity between CPU and memory operations. CPUs are so fast that it takes multiple clock cycles just for an electrical signal to travel from one end of the chip to the other - we're literally constrained by the _speed of light_ through copper! This means that accessing main memory will always be _orders of magnitude slower_ than CPU operations.

To mitigate this, processors use a complex _cache hierarchy_. How our algorithms access memory - their _data access patterns_ - often has a more significant impact on performance than algorithmic complexity. The key principle is _spatial locality_: try to store data that will be accessed together close to each other in memory, allowing the CPU to make better use of its cache.

## I/O and User Experience
> Design for _asynchronous I/O_ to create _responsive applications_.

In most applications, I/O operations are the major performance bottleneck. Storage devices, network connections, and other I/O interfaces operate at speeds thousands or millions of times slower than CPU operations. Here's a rough comparison:
- CPU cycle: 0.3 nanoseconds
- Memory access: 100 nanoseconds
- SSD access: 100 microseconds
- HDD access: 10 milliseconds
- Network request: 100+ milliseconds

The solution isn't just to move I/O operations to background threads - that's only half the battle. The real challenge is _architecting_ your application to handle I/O asynchronously while maintaining a _responsive user interface_. Implement techniques like:
- _Progressive loading_ and infinite scrolling
- _Optimistic UI_ updates
- _Pre-fetching_ and _caching_
- _Skeleton screens_ during loading
- _Meaningful progress_ indicators

## The Bottom Line
> Writing code is _cheap_, but _maintaining_ it is expensive.

Remember: _premature optimization_ is the root of all evil. Before optimizing anything, ensure you have:
1. Clear _performance requirements_
2. Actual _performance measurements_
3. _Profiling data_ to identify bottlenecks

Focus first on writing _clear, maintainable code_. Only optimize when you have _evidence_ that a specific part of your code is causing performance issues. Your future self (and your colleagues) will thank you.
