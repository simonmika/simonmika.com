title: Rock Star Programmers
---
Sometimes I come across programmers that view themselves as rock stars. Some even label themselves code ninjas, as if they are some kind of programming superhero with special powers.

While I do realize where this comes from - a good programmer can easily be more than ten times as productive as an average one - we do also need good role models and front figures for our profession.

> Programming is not a one man show.

But programming is almost never a one-man show. Most real-world projects are impossible to finish by yourself within a reasonable time. They are team efforts. Therefore, a real programming hero is someone who not only is a very productive expert but who also helps the rest of the team to reach their full potential by mentoring and encouraging them.

The rock star attitude is the opposite of the humble and encouraging attitude of a good mentor. So let us stop talking about code ninjas as a good thing and instead let us celebrate the mentors.
