title: Naming

Almost all concepts programming languages provide to create [abstractions](../abstractions) have one really important thing in common. They all have the ability to name the abstraction. This is among others true for, variables, functions, classes and name spaces.

> The name is the most important part of a good abstraction.

In fact the name is their most important feature. Without a descriptive name it wouldn't be an abstraction any more. Every time we needed to use a unnamed abstraction we would need to look inside it to find out which one it is. That totally defeats the [purpose of creating abstractions](../abstractions) in the first place.

For many problem domain their does not exist a good and stringent enough nomenclature. We therefore usually need to create one. When we do that we should take that task seriously. Getting it right will not only make it easier for the programmers following in out footsteps but also for ourselves. Good names help us to reason about a problem. We should also spend effort to document our definitions of the different names used as a reminder to ourselves and to help future programmers.

Getting naming right is one of the really hard parts of programming. It is at the core of why	it sometimes is easier to start over from scratch then to incrementally improve code written by others. By putting more effort into the naming you can avoid a lot of trouble and refactoring later.
