      <description>We humans can in our head only concurrently work with about eight items. If we try to work with significantly more we will lose some items. It is the human equivalent of a stack overflow. Our stack has a maximum depth of about eight. In order to handle more we need to bundle items together into a new item. It is the equivalent of grouping them together in a data structure and putting them into the heap and just store the pointer to it all on the stack.</description>
